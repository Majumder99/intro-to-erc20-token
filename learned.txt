Minting refers to the creation of new crypto coins in the form of 
rewards for validators for confirmation of transaction blocks, data 
authentication and recording new transaction blocks on the 
blockchain. Crypto minting follows the Proof of Stake consensus 
algorithm and has a significant relationship with staking.
